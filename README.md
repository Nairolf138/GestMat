# GestMat

GestMat provides a minimal playground for composing singular modules and evolving them into living organisms. The repository is structured so that reusable pieces live in `singular/`, assembled entities in `organisms/` and their execution logs in `runs/`.

## Quick Start

The command line interface exposes three helper commands:

```bash
birth  # create the initial scaffolding
run    # execute the current organism
talk   # open an interactive session with the running organism
```

Python 3.10 or newer is required.
